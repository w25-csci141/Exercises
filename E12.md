# Lecture 12 - Exercises

### 12B - Tuples

1. What does the following code print?

   ```python
   a = 1
   b = 2
   c = 3
   
   v = (a, a, c)
   
   print(v, sep=" ")
   ```

2. What does the following code print?

   ```python
   a = 1
   b = 2
   c = 3
   
   a, b, c = (a, a, c)
   
   print(a, b, c, sep=" ")
   ```


3. Suppose the following code is executed. The numbers at left are line  numbers and are not part of the code itself. If any line causes an  error, assume that line is not run and continue execution with the next  line.

   ```python
   1   a, b, c = 6, 4, 2
   2   (z, x) = c, b
   3   print((x, z))
   4   v = (x, z, c)
   5   print(v)
   6   a, b = v
   ```

   1. Which line(s), if any, cause errors? List all that apply.
   2. What does line 5 print?
   
4. Consider the following function:

   ```python
   def f(a, b):
     xa, ya = a
     xb, yb = b
     return (ya, xa), (yb, xb)
   
   ```

   For each of the following calls to the above function, say what the function returns, or "error" if an error will occur.

   1. `f(1, 2)`
   2. `f(1, 2, 3, 4)`
   3. `f((1, 2), (3, 4))`
   4. `f(((1, 1), 2), (3, 4))`
   5. `f((1, 1, 2), (3, 4))`
