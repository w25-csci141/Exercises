# Lecture 8 - Exercises

### 8A - For Loops

1. What does the following program print?

   ```python
   m = 0
   for n in [1.8, 4.2, 1.6, 2.0, 1.88]:
     m += int(n)
   print(m)
   ```

2. What is the output of the following program?

   ```python
   s = ""
   i = 1
   for digit in ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"]:
     if len(digit) < 5 and i % 2 == 1:
     	s = digit + s
     i += 1
   print(s)
   ```

### 8B - The `range` function

#### What does each of the following `range` calls, converted to a list, evaluate to?
3. `list(range(3))`
4. `list(range(4, 7))`
5. `list(range(4, 0, -1))`

#### How many elements are in the following ranges?

6. `range(732)`
7. `range(6, 88)`
8. `range(4, 2)`
9. `range(20, 21)`
10. `range(0)`

11. What does the following program print?

   ```python
   for x in range(1,4):
      print(x + x * x, end=str(x))
   ```
#### Consider the following incomplete program:

   ```python
   x = 
   y = 
   for z in range(x, y):
     print("WWU")
   ```

12. What pairs of values could be assigned to the variables `x` and `y` so that the program prints `WWU` 43 times? Select all correct choices.

      1. `x: 0   y: 44`
      2. `x: -21  y: 22` 
      3. `x: -21  y:21`
      4. `x: -789 y: -746`
      5. `x: -789 y: 746` 
      6. `x: 1   y: 44` 

13. Earlier in the class you were given an optional POTD to write a program that prompts the user for a positive integer $p$ and prints the powers of 2 up to $2^p$ (starting at $p$ == 0). Rewrite the program to use a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop.
