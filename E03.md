# Lecture 3 - Exercises

### 3A - Operators and Operator Precedence

1. Evaluate each of the following expressions. Be sure to properly indicate the type of the value, for example by including a decimal point if the result is a `float` or enclosing it in double quotes if it's a `str`.
   1. `9 / 3`
   2. `9 // 3`
   3. `10 // 3`
   4. `10 % 3`
   5. `3 % 10`
   6. `2 ** 3`
   7. `"abc" + "def"`
   8. `"baa " * 2`
2. Evaluate each of the following expressions. As before, be sure to be precise about the type of the resulting value.
   1. `(9 % ( 6 // 2))`
   2. `9 % 6 // 2`
   3. `2 ** 2 ** 4`
   4. `("na" * 8 + " ") * 2 + "Batman!"`
   5. ` 1 + 2 ** 3 / 4 * 5 - (6 % 7)`

### 3B - Program Execution and Return Values

3. For each of the following, say whether it is a statement or an expression:
   
   1. `a = 4`
   2. `a + 4`
   3. `int(6.4) + 2`
   
4. Suppose we run the following program, and the user types `6` and presses enter. What happens?

   ```python
   user_num = input("Enter a number: ")
   result = 5 % (3 ** (user_num // 4))
   ```

5. Suppose we run the following program, and the user types `6` and presses enter. What value gets stored in `result`?

   ```python
   user_num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
   result = 5 % (3 ** (user_num // 4))
   ```

6. What does the following expression evaluate to? `float(str(int(2.6 / 2))*2)`
