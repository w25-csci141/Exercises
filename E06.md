# Lecture 6 - Exercises

### 6A - Conditional Statements

1. What does the following program print?

   ```python
   wwu_founded = 1893
   if (wwu_founded // 1000) < 1:
       wwu_founded = "eighteen ninety three"
   if type(wwu_founded) == type("some text"):
       print("WWU was founded in", wwu_founded)
   else:
       print("Year founded:", wwu_founded)
   ```

2. Some of the following expressions could fill in the blank below to make the following program print `oolong`. Which ones are they?

   ```python
   if (True and (_______ or not True)) and not False:
       print("green")
   else:
       print("oolong")
   ```

   1. `True`
   2. `False`
   3. `not True`
   4. `not False`
   5. `3 == 4`
   6. `17 % 2 == 1`

3. Is there anything that could fill in the blank in the program above that would cause the program to print both `green` and `oolong`?

### 6B - Nested and Chained Conditionals

#### Consider the following program. 

   ```python
   # assume x and y are numbers
   if x < y:
       print("x is less than y")
   else:
       if x > y:
           print("x is greater than y")
       else:
           print("x and y must be equal")
   ```

4. How many comparison operators (`>`, `<`) are evaluated when the program is run with `x` set to `4` and `y` set to `5`?
5. How many comparison operators (`>`, `<`) are evaluated when the program is run with `x` set to `8` and `y` set to `3`?
6. Rewrite the program to use chained conditionals (i.e., `elif`) instead of nested `if` statements.

#### Consider the following program:

   ```python
   # Program 0:
   if (a < 0) == True:
       print(0)
   else:
       if a >= 0:
           print(a)
   ```

7. Which of the following programs are equivalent to Program 0?  In other words, which of the following has exactly the same output regardless of the value of `a`? (hint: what values of 'a' would you want to check in a test table?)

   ```python
   # Program 1:
   if a < 0:
       print(0)
   else:
       print(a)
   
   # Program 2:
   if (a < 0) == True:
       print(0)
   print(a)
   
   # Program 3:
   if (a > 0) == True:
       print(a)
   else:
       print(0)
   
   # Program 4:
   if (a < 0) == True:
       print(0)
   if a >= 0:
       print(a)
   ```

8. Of the programs above that are equivalent to 0 (including Program 0 itself), which is the simplest and thus most preferable way to write it?

9. Consider the following three programs. Give the **smallest positive integer** value for the variable `num_tacos` such that the three programs print **exactly** the same thing when they are executed. Hint: what values would you put in a testing table?

   **Program 1:**

   ```python
   if (num_tacos == 32):
       print("32 tacos")
   elif (num_tacos < 32):
       print("Too few tacos")
   elif (num_tacos == 32):
       print("32 tacos")
   elif (num_tacos % 5 == 0):
       print("Oh yes, tacos!")
   else:
       print("Too many tacos") 
   ```

   **Program 2:**

   ```python
   if (num_tacos == 32):
       print("32 tacos")
   if (num_tacos < 32):
       print("Too few tacos")
   if (num_tacos == 33):
       print("33 tacos")
   if (num_tacos % 5 == 0):
       print("Oh yes, tacos!")
   else:
       print ("Too many tacos")
   ```

   **Program 3:**

   ```python
   if (num_tacos == 32):
       print("32 tacos")
   else:
       if (num_tacos < 32):
           print("Too few tacos")
       else:
           if (num_tacos == 34):
             print("34 tacos")
           else:
               if (num_tacos % 5 == 0):
                   print("Oh yes, tacos!")
               else:
                   print ("Too many tacos")
   ```
