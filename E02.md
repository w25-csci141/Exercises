# Lecture 2 - Exercises

### 2A - Data Types

1. What is the result of each of the following function calls?
   1. `type(7.0)`
   2. `type("7.0")`
   3. `type(7)`
   4. `float(7)`
   5. `str(7.0)`
   6. `type(3+4)`
2. If you pass a positive `float` argument to the `int` function, which of the following does it do?
   * Throw an error
   * Round to the nearest integer
   * Always round down
   * Always round up

### 2B - Variables and Assignment

3. Which of the following does not print the same thing as the others?
   
   Program A:
   
   ```python
   a = 14
   b = 3
   print(a, b)
   ```
   
   Program B:
   ```python
   a = 3
   b = 14
   print(14, 3)
   ```
   
   Program C:
   ```python
   a = 14
   b = a
   print(a, b)
   ```
   
   Program D:
   ```python
   a = 3
   b = 14
   print(14, a)
   ```
   
4. Consider the following program:

   ```python
   a = 5
   b = 5
   a = 6
   b = 7
   ```

   After this program executes, what values do `a` and `b` hold?

5. What does the following program print?

   ```python
   x = 3.0
   m = 2.0
   b = -4.0
   y = m * x + b
   print(y)
   ```
