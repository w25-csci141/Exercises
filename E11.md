# Lecture 11 - Exercises

### 11A - Docstrings, Preconditions, Postconditions

1. Which of the following belongs in a function's docstring? List all that apply.          

   1. Preconditions
   2. Postconditions
   3. The steps the function takes to accomplish its task
   4. Information about side-effects the function has
   5. Information about the meaning of the arguments passed to the function

#### Consider the following function:

   ```python
   def print_squares(n):
     """ docstring missing! help! """
     i = 0
     while i < n:
       i += 1
       print(i, i**2)
   
     return i**2
   ```

2. Which of the following should be included in the docstring? List all that apply.
   
   a. The function prints the square of each number from 1 through `n`

   b. The function uses a `while` loop

   c. The function returns the square of `n`

   d. The function returns the square of `i`

   e. The function uses a counter variable called `i`

4. Even with the correct subset of the above, the function could result in an error. Write a **precondition** that can be included such that as long as the precondition is satisfied, the function cannot cause an error.

### 11B - Parameters, Local Variables, and Scope

#### Consider the following program, noticing that several points in the code are marked with comments (e.g., `M1`). **Important:** the markers refer to the lines they're **on**, not the lines following them.

   ```python
   # M1
   def a(v1, v2):
       # M2
       v3 = v1 + v2
       # M3
       print(v3)
   
   # M4
   a(4, 6)
   # M5
   ```

4. In which lines (among `M1` through `M5`) is `v2` in scope? List all that apply.
5. In which lines (among `M1` through `M5`) is `v3` in scope? List all that apply.

#### Consider the following program:

   ```python
   def print_rectangle_area(width, height):
       """ Print the area of a width-by-height
           rectangle. Pre: width and height are numbers. """
   
       area = width * height
       print(area)
   
   w = 4
   h = 3
   a = w * h
   print_rectangle_area(w, h)
   ```

 6. Which of the following could replace the last line of the program and leave its behavior unchanged? List all that apply.

   (a) `print(h*w)`

   (b) `print(width * height)`

   (c) `print(w * h)`

   (d) `print_rectangle_area(h, w)`

7. What does the following program print?

   ```python
   def f(x):
       g(3 * x)
   
   def g(x):
       print(x + 2)
   
   f(4)
   ```

8. What does the following program print?

   ```python
   x = 4
   
   def f(x):
       return 3 * x
   
   def g(x):
       return x + 2
   
   print(f(g(x)))
   print(g(f(x)))
   ```
