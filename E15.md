# Lecture 15 - Exercises

### 15A - List Basics

### Suppose that I've created a list as follows: `starks = ["Ned", "Arya", "Bran", "Sansa"]`

For each of the following expressions, write what it evaluates to.
   
1. `"Ned" in starks`
2. `"Sansa" in starks[1:3]`
3. `len(starks[1:4]) == 3`
4. `"Arya" in (starks + ["Jon"])[2:]`
5. `len(starks[1:2]) * 4 == 8`
6. `starks[4:] + starks[1:2]`
7. `starks[3] + starks[1]`

### 15B - List Methods and Mutability

8. Write the contents of `a` (as it would be printed by Python) after **each** line of the following program.

    ```python
    a = ["Abe", "Ike"]
    a.append("JFK")
    a.extend(["FDR", "Geo"])
    a[0] = a[:2]
    a[1:2] = a[3:]
    a[0][1] = a[3]
    ```
    
9. Execute the numbered lines below in order; if one causes an error, assume it is skipped before continuing on. List all the line numbers that do **not** cause errors.

    ```python
    1  A = ["Tony", "Steve"]
    2  B = ("Tony", "Steve")
    3  C = "Tony, Steve"
    4  A[0] = "Thor"
    5  B[0] = "Thor"
    6  print(A[0] + C[:4])
    7  C[0] = "P"
    8  A[1:] = ["Bruce", "Natasha"]
    ```

10. What does the following print? Be sure to check your answer on this one using Thonny.

   ```python
   a = [1, 2, 3]
   b = a + [4, 5]
   a.append("abc")
   a.extend("abc")
   print(a)
   ```
