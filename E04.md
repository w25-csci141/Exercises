# Lecture 4 - Exercises

### 4A - `print`'s keyword arguments

1. Which of the following is printed by: `print("B", "C", "D", "BR", sep="A")`

   1. BACADABR
   2. ABACADABRA
   3. ABACADABR
   4. BACADABRA

2. What is printed by the following code?

   ```python
   print("Name: ", end="\n---\n")
   print("Date:", end="\n---\n")
   ```

3. What does the following program print?

   ```python
   a = 31
   b = a // 4
   c = (5 % b) - 1.0
   print("a", a ** 0, sep=": ", end=";  ")
   print("b", b - 4, sep=": ", end=";  ")
   print("c", c * 2, sep=": ")
   ```

4. Prompt the user for three numbers and print their sum without spaces between the numbers and operators, using what you learned about the `print` function's keyword arguments.

   ```
   Enter the first number: 4
   Enter the second number: 2.4
   Enter the third number: 8.6
   4.0+2.4+8.6=15.0
   ```
