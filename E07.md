# Lecture 7 - Exercises

### 7A - While Loops

1. What does the following program print?

   ```python
   count = 10
   while count < 21:
       print(count, end=" ")
       count += 3
   ```

#### Consider the following program:

   ```python
   n = 12345
   m = 0
   while n != 0:
       m = (10 * m) + (n % 10)
       n //= 10
   ```

2. How many times is the body of the `while` loop executed?
3. What are the values of `m` and `n` after the code is executed?

#### Consider the following code, which has two missing snippets, marked `[[1]]` and `[[2]]`.

   ```python
   i = [[1]]
   while [[2]]:
     i += 1
     print(i)
   ```

   #### Consider the following candidates to replace the missing snippet `[[1]]`:

   (a) `0`

   (b) `1`

   (c) `10`

   #### and the following candidates to replace missing snipped `[[2]]`:

   (i) `i < 9`

   (ii) `i <= 9`

   (iii) `i < 10`

   (iv) `i <= 10`

   To form a complete program, we need to pick a pair of snippets, one to replace `[[1]]` and one to replace `[[2]]`.

4. Which pair or pairs of snippets will cause the program to print the numbers from 1 to 10, inclusive?
5. Which pair or pairs of snippets will cause the program to print exactly 10 numbers? 

### 7B - Nested while loops

#### Consider the following program:

   ```python
   i = 0
   while i < 4:
     j = 1
     while j < 11:
       print('*', end='')
       j += 1
     i += 1
     print()
   ```

6. How many asterisks (`*`) are printed by the program?
7. What are the values of `i` and `j` at the end of the program?
