### 10A - Defining Functions

1. Which of the following is/are true of the `print` function?

   1. It does not take inputs (arguments)
   2. It does not return a value
   3. It does not have any effects
   4. Using it requires understanding the code that implements

2. You've seen the `len` function a couple times now. Describe its behavior in terms of its *inputs*, *effects*, and *return value*.

   * Input(s): 
   * Effects:
   * Return value:

3. Which of the following programs will **not** cause an error when run?

   1. ```python
      def greet():
        print("Hi there!")
      greet()
      ```

   2. ```python
      def greet():
        print("Hi there!")
      ```
   3. ```python
      greet()
      def greet():
           print("Hi there!")
      ```
      
   4. ```python
      def greet:
        print("Hi there!")
      greet()
      ```


### 10B - Passing inputs to functions

#### Consider the following program: 

   ```python
   def h2m(hours, minutes):
     total_mins = 60 * hours + minutes
     return total_mins
   
   arg1 = int(sys.argv[1])
   arg2 = int(sys.argv[2])
   
   print(h2m(arg1, arg2))
   ```
4. Optional: what part of functions would you like to have more explainations of in the videos?
5. Suppose the program is run with two command line arguments and prints `80`. If the first command line argument was `1`, what must the second one have been?
6. Suppose the program is run with two command line arguments and prints `80`. If you don't know anything about either command line argument, how many possible pairs of numbers could have been given as command line arguments? (hint: what are you assuming? Can you assume that?)

#### Consider the following program:

   ```python
   def pnmr(n, r):
       print(n % r, end=" ")
   
   size = 7
   rad = 3
   for num in range(0,size):
       pnmr(num, rad)
   ```

7. How many numbers does this program print? Count total number printed, _not_ digits or unique numbers.
8. How many times does the program print the number 1?
