# Lecture 13 - Exercises

### 13A - Strings and Tuples are Sequences

1. Consider the following function:

   ```python
   def pr(a):
       for c in a:
           print(c, c, end=" ")
   
   ```
   
   The result of calling this function with a particular string `a` is `C C S S C C E E Y Y E E`. What was `a`?
   
2. What does the following program print?

   ```python
   def fl(tu):
     	r = ""
     	for v in tu:
       		r += str(v + v)
     	return r
   print(fl(("A", "C", 3)))
   ```


### 13B - Indexing and Slicing

3. Suppose `s = "Winter is coming."` Which of the following evaluates to `"r"`?

    1. `s[5]`
    2. `s(5)`
    3. `s[6]`
    4. `s(6)`
    
4. Suppose `last_name = "Wehrwein"`. Which of the following evaluates to `"in"`? List all that apply.

    1. `last_name[7:8]`
    2. `last_name[-2:8]`
    3. `last_name[6:-1]`
    4. `last_name[-3:]`
    5. `last_name[6:]`

5. Which of the following evaluates to the last character of a string `s`?

    1. `s[len(s) - 1]`
    2. `s[len(s)]`
    3. `s[len(s) + 1]`
    4. `s[42]`

6. Suppose `last_name = "wehrwein"`. For which of the following `a` and `b` will `last_name[a] == last_name[b]` evaluate to `True`? List all that apply.

    1. `a = 1`, `b = 5`
    2. `a = 1`, `b = 7`
    3. `a = 8`, `b = -4`
    4. `a = -2`, `b = -6`

7. What does the following code print?

    ```python
    m = (4, 1, 2, 2, 2)
    s = "Scott"
    for i in range(len(s)):
        print(s[i] * m[i], end="")
    ```

8. Consider the following function:

   ```python
   def flop(value, number):
       output = ""
       for i in range(number, 0, -1):
           output = output + value[i-1]
   
       for i in range(number, len(value)):
           output = output + value[i]
       return output
   ```

   Suppose `a` contains an integer. Which of the following are possible return values of the following call:

   ```python
   flop("no time", a)
   ```
   
    List all that apply:
   
   1. `mit one`
   2. `nomite`
   3. `t onime`
   4. `on time`
   5. `emit on`
   6. `timeno time`
