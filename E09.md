# Lecture 9 - Exercises

### 9A - import statements

1. Which of the following programs will **not** cause an error when run?

   1. ```python
      import random
      random.randint(6, 10)
      ```

   2. ```python
      import random
      random.randint(10)
      ```

   3. ```python
      from math import sin
      sin(math.pi)
      ```

   4. ```python
      import math
      from math import cos
      cos(math.pi)
      ```

   5. ```python
      import math
      from math import cos
      math.cos(math.pi)
      ```

2. What is the largest number that could be printed by the following program?

   ```python
   import math
   import random
   
   print(math.ceil(random.uniform(random.random()*10, 30)))
   ```

3. What is the difference between the `random` module's `randint` and `randrange` functions?

### 9B - Turtles

As a reminder, for both of the following problems, I highly recommend trying to answer them before running the code to verify your answer.

4. Describe in words what the following code draws on the Turtle's canvas:

   ```python
   import turtle
   t = turtle.Turtle()
   for i in range(30):
       t.forward(5)
       t.penup()
       t.forward(5)
       t.pendown()
   ```

5. After the above code is run, what is its position (in x, y coordinates) on the canvas? You should be able to find the information needed to answer this question in the `turtle` module's documentation.
